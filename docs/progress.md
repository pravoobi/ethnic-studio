# Progress Log

## 2026-09-17 — Setup + spike (Day 1)

**Shipped**
- Repo scaffolded: Next.js 15.5 (App Router, TS strict, Tailwind), pnpm, git initialized.
- Folder structure per CLAUDE.md: `app/(seller)/upload`, `app/(seller)/dashboard`, `app/(buyer)/catalog`,
  `app/api/{sign-upload,pipeline/[id],export/[id]}`.
- `lib/cloudinary/{client,transforms,metadata,search}.ts`, `lib/presets.ts`, `lib/pipeline.ts`.
  `transforms.ts` is fully implemented and unit tested (pure string builders, no live Cloudinary calls).
  `client.ts`/`metadata.ts`/`search.ts`/`pipeline.ts` and all three API routes are typed stubs that
  throw/501 clearly — see `docs/decisions.md`.
- Prisma schema (SQLite dev) with a minimal `Garment` model.
- `.env.example`, this file, and `docs/decisions.md` created.
- `pnpm build && pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint && pnpm test` all green on the scaffold.

**Blocked**
- No Cloudinary account/credentials yet — nothing in `.env.local`. Required before any real
  upload/cutout/tag/crop/generative work (Sep 19-22 phase) can start.
- Track decision (Track 2 vs Track 3) not made yet — depends on hand-testing generative features
  against free-tier quota.

**Next**
- Decide track by Sep 18 EOD; record the decision here and update the track line in `CLAUDE.md`.

## 2026-09-17 — Spike-test tooling ready

**Shipped**
- `scripts/spike-test.ts` (`pnpm spike`): hand-tests every pipeline feature (upload,
  auto-tagging add-on, background-removal add-on, smart crop, `e_gen_background_replace`
  ×3 presets, `e_gen_recolor` ×4 swatches) against every photo in `fixtures/spike-photos/`,
  using the real `lib/cloudinary/transforms.ts` builders. Pulls account credit usage
  before/after via the Admin API. Writes full results to `docs/spike-results.json`
  (gitignored — local only).
- Switched `lib/cloudinary/transforms.ts`/`search.ts` to relative imports (instead of the
  `@/` alias) so these pure modules run under plain Node/tsx, not just inside Next's bundler.

**Blocked (unchanged)**
- Cloudinary account exists but `.env.local` isn't populated yet, and no real garment photos
  are in `fixtures/spike-photos/` yet — both needed before `pnpm spike` can actually run.

**Next**
1. Fill `.env.local` from `.env.example` (never share these values in chat).
2. Drop 3 real garment photos into `fixtures/spike-photos/`.
3. Run `pnpm spike`, share the console output (not the photos/credentials) — use it to note
   real credit cost per feature and confirm which add-ons are actually active on the free tier.
4. Decide track (2 vs 3) by Sep 18 EOD based on what's reliable; update this file + `CLAUDE.md`.
